Quack, the Qualitative and Usable Aur paCKage helper. Also, it sounds
like a duck. Quack Quack.

* Goal of the project

This is a single file, auditable and readable (at least I tryied) AUR
helper. It let you easily verify that it does nothing wrong. Since it
has to gain root privileges at some times, It is very important for me
that you stay able to understand what it does.

This script aims to stay only a helper. Nothing more. Thus, it will
never include a parser or complex solver. You are intended to play this
role and stay in command.

* Installation

Requirements are listed in the =requirements.txt= file.

Then, just run =make install=

* Usage

See =quack -h=
